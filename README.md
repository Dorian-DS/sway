# My setup

These are my dotfiles for sway and waybar.  They go under ~/.config

For my setup, I use the following
- sakura (Terminal)
- thunar (File manager)
- oguri (required for swayblur)
- swayblur (blurs wallpaper when windows are open)
- lxpolkit (to prompt for elevated privs)
- wlogout (logout/restart/shutdown menu)
- ulauncher (replaced dmenu for launching apps)

Enjoy!
